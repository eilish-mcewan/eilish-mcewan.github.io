    <h2>Identity Values</h2>

    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="flex-item">
        <em
          >Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</em
        >My biggest ethical flex was a recent decision I made for my own health.
        The values I had to weigh up was a nice steady income, or recovering
        from a concussion and getting a handle on my PTSD. I had tried for
        months to make everything work in concert, but it was obvious I needed
        to take a back seat for a bit. I chose my health and it is one of my
        proudest decisions.

      <div class="flex-item">
        <em
          >Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.</em
        >
        Even though my immediate family has had a huge impact on who I am, I
        would like to talk about the impact my chosen family has had. They have
        taught me loyalty, the value of hard work, resilience, and kindness.
        Without the fortitude of character I have around me in my best friends,
        I would be lost.

      <div class="flex-item">
        <em
          >Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.</em
        >
        I approach most things with humour. Sometimes too much and it can get a
        bit unserious. But I think it works in my favour as a stress reliever.
        My other strengths are my creativity, which I think is the backbone of
        problem solving. In the modern age we have so many different avenues we
        can use to solve problems, and I think all of them have their time and
        place. Something else that might help me is my ability to hyperfixate on
        tasks hahahaha.
      </div>
      <div class="flex-item">
        <em
          >Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?</em
        >
        My health again, is a big one. And while my ability to hyperfixate can
        help me, it can also mean I forget to take breaks, leave things until
        the last minute, and forget to eat. If I'm being very honest about my
        flaws right now. My disabilities have been both a hindrance and a
        blessing, but during this journey I would like to learn to be proactive
        and manage my time wisely. I believe I can do it. Sprint 2 hasn't been
        the greatest in that regard but I'm resilient and will keep trying until
        I strike the balance. I want to meet every deadline. By the end of
        Foundations I want to have planned and developed a good routine to
        facilitate these dreams.

      <div class="flex-item">
        <em
          >Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.</em
        >
        In University I had a really embarrassing moment that still makes me
        cringe now. I completely ghosted a group project and got flamed by the
        professor for it. I gave no notice of what was going on with me, and I
        was too shy to talk to the other members of my group. I've learnt a lot
        from that experience. 1. Never ghost (in a professional environment,
        unless there is abject disrespect from the other party, in that case I
        support ghosting), 2. ALWAYS give appropriate and timely notice of
        what's going awry, and 3. try to see the situation from the other
        party's perspective.
