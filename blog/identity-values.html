      >My biggest ethical flex was a recent decision I made for my own health.
      The values I had to weigh up was a nice steady income, or recovering from
      a concussion and getting a handle on my PTSD. I had tried for months to
      make everything work in concert, but it was obvious I needed to take a
      back seat for a bit. I chose my health and it is one of my proudest
      decisions.

        your values and identity.</em
      >
      Even though my immediate family has had a huge impact on who I am, I would
      like to talk about the impact my chosen family has had. They have taught
      me loyalty, the value of hard work, resilience, and kindness. Without the
      fortitude of character I have around me in my best friends, I would be
      lost.

        >Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.</em
      >
      I approach most things with humour. Sometimes too much and it can get a
      bit unserious. But I think it works in my favour as a stress reliever. My
      other strengths are my creativity, which I think is the backbone of
      problem solving. In the modern age we have so many different avenues we
      can use to solve problems, and I think all of them have their time and
      place. Something else that might help me is my ability to hyperfixate on
      tasks hahahaha.

      <em
        >Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?</em
      >
      My health again, is a big one. And while my ability to hyperfixate can
      help me, it can also mean I forget to take breaks, leave things until the
      last minute, and forget to eat. If I'm being very honest about my flaws
      right now. My disabilities have been both a hindrance and a blessing, but
      during this journey I would like to learn to be proactive and manage my
      time wisely. I believe I can do it. Sprint 2 hasn't been the greatest in
      that regard but I'm resilient and will keep trying until I strike the
      balance. I want to meet every deadline. By the end of Foundations I want
      to have planned and developed a good routine to facilitate these dreams.

        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what

      >
      In University I had a really embarrassing moment that still makes me
      cringe now. I completely ghosted a group project and got flamed by the
      professor for it. I gave no notice of what was going on with me, and I was
      too shy to talk to the other members of my group. I've learnt a lot from
      that experience. 1. Never ghost (in a professional environment, unless
      there is abject disrespect from the other party, in that case I support
      ghosting), 2. ALWAYS give appropriate and timely notice of what's going
      awry, and 3. try to see the situation from the other party's perspective.
