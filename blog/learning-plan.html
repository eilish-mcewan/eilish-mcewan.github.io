      <em>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</em> I want a career
      that is challenging, rewarding, and flexible enough to allow me to take
      care of my health around my commitments. Oh and, obviously, I want to do
      dev stuff as that career.

      <div class="flex-item">
      <em
        >A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning</em
      > Strengths: resilience, creativity, humour, neurodivergence. Limitations:
      poor time management, neurodivergence, eye sight?

      <div class="flex-item">
      <em
        >What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</em
      > I want to be able to easily connect with others. And not be afraid of
      other people. I'm not sure if that's something DA can fix, and I know I
      can put in a more concerted effort too. But I would really like that.
      </div>
      <div class="flex-item">
      I'd like to make a commitment to DA, my classmates, and industry reps that
      I will hand in work on by the deadline. I will do this by coding every
      day, even if it's just a little. If things are building up, I'll contact a
      facilitator for assistance. Through routine, self-care, and
      self-compassion I will be able to achieve this commitment. I will work
      respectfully and thoughtfully with my clasmates. I expect the facilitation
      team to make their channels of communication obvious, and to be
      compassionate and understanding. I have no block-out times as yet. I may
      change this in the future to include routine self-care. But for now I'm a
      free agent baby! This will change closer to Bootcamp.
