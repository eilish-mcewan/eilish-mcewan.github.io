    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="flex-item">
        <em
          >What are three new things you have learnt about yourself 
          and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?</em
        > That it's easy for me to feel a bit defeated if I can't solve a problem right away.
        I need to remind myself that it means I'm learning, and sometimes learning is hard, 
        and that being good at everything right away would be boring. I've also learnt that I'm
        very bad at time management.

      <div class="flex-item">
        <em
          >What are the role of values, empathy, and 
          self-awareness in learning and programming?</em
        >
         Values ensure we are motivated by principle and not external factors. Empathy is important
        for connecting with others, relating to others, and getting jobs. Self-awareness is about
        refinement. How could I have done this better? Was I listening to that person or just hearing them?

        <em
          >What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</em
        >
         How much I enjoy the writing and reflection, and how much it solidifies my learning.

      <div class="flex-item">
        <em
          >What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</em
        >
          Probably the learning plan? I feel like I need constant reminders of it. I think
         it was also challenging to formulate.
      </div>
      <div class="flex-item">
        <em
          >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</em
        >
        It helps us to get jobs and become better humans!
      </div>
      <div class="flex-item">
        <em
          >Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</em
        >
         I definitely don't feel like it was a waste of time. I learnt a lot about myself. My strengths and my weaknesses, what I want to be like, what I need to do
         to look after myself, how important growth mindset is and how just knowing you can grow can make you perform better. I value the human skills
         portion of this course a lot and I hope that it's kept for future students.
