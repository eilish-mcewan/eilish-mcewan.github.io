    <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>

      Neuroplasticity is the ability through which our brains form new neural connections and pathways. But what the heck
      does that mean? It basically means that our brains are always, always growing. Neuroplasticity is a relatively
      new concept, and it sheds new light on the ways we can become agents over our own behaviour and learning. If a behaviour 
      is reinforced repetitively, our brain carves out new pathways that get deeper as the behaviour is repeated. For example, 
      if you smoke cigarettes every time you're really stressed, your brain will create a neural pathway over time, and every 
      time you're really stressed it'll say "please give me a cigarette!" Adversely, it means that quitting that habit 
      and replacing it with something healthier is all the more possible too. Neuroplasticity can work for you, or against 
      you. A couple of ways to increase your neuroplasticity are metacognition (eg. Journalling) and *drumroll* Mindfulness. As 
      well as a healthy diet and exercise. The brain loves nutrition and bloodflow, trust me. Here's a video by Dr. Tracey Marks 
      about Neuroplasticity if you'd like to<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dr+tracey+marks+neuroplasticity&oq=dr+tracey+marks+neuroplasticity&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDcyNTZqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#"> learn more.</a>

     Now pretend we didn't just learn what neuroplasticity is. Let's go to the before times. PREVIOUSLY our brains were thought 
     to be "fixed" and are now believed to be "plastic" thanks to neuroplasticity. The concept of a Growth Mindset sits 
     alongside neuroplasticity because it means that we can believe we're capable of being more than we are, because we 
     are. If you're scared of becoming your parents, believe that you don't have to be, and you won't. We're not fated 
     to destiny or to repeat what's already played out. And if we know that, we have a better chance of beating the odds. 
     I wouldn't be at Dev Academy if I thought I wasn't able to be really good at this. I'm not yet, but because of neuroplasticity 
     and my sheer belief, I have a better shot. Shoot for the moon and you'll land on a star et cetera.
