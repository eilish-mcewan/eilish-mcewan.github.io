     I've found media queries and resposinveness to be really tricky. Media queries make your website easier to use on different devices. I don't know if it's because the other CSS in my stylesheet
     overrides the media queries or what, but I feel like I've tried everything. I've googled countless times, tried "trying" something, tried talking
     about it - but I haven't found a fix so far. I've felt mostly frustration throughout the process. And I'm not sure how much I've learnt yet.

      A problem I did have that I thought I solved with relative ease was linking all of my HTML to my stylesheet. HTML is like the meat of a webpage, and CSS is all the decoration.
      It shouldn't have been a big problem for me, that's how I felt anyway. But linking CSS to HTML was something I found tricky, but when you get it,
      it makes sense and it's something you never have to learn again. Unless I've still got it wrong. Haha. I love how easy it makes modifying all of your HTml pages.

      The problem solving technique I am most adept in is "trying something" AKA the "fuck around an find out" method. Although I feel as though
       it's not always the simplest or fastest way to solve my problem sometimes. However, where trying something fails, 
       Google is always there. As well as console.logging and asking my classmates. I haven't yet used the rubber ducky method and I have yet
       to be able to elegantly decode error messages. I think I broke the Javascript Kata because it won't run any tests for me anymore haha. Oops.
