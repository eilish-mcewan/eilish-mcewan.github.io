        Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on
        his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi
        (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a
        short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother
        to prepare the hangi. Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te
        Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people
        who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like
        the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe
        (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up
        properly<a href="/blog/te-houtaewa-template.html"> ... Read more</a>

        A 'position' is a property in CSS that defines how the element interacts
        with the page. Relative, absolute, and fixed Positioning are important
        to understand because they can be really useful when you want to move or
        static-ify elements on a page. Let's start with relative positioning. If
        I have an image at the top of my webpage and I scroll, the image will
        not be lost into the scroll multiverse. That is to say that it won't
        disappear once you scroll down. You can also add fancy properties to
        place the component exactly where you want relative to its original
        position in the document flow. Absolute positioning is a bit different.
        It's literally a post-it for your computer screen. You can position it
        anywhere you want and it'll just stay there. BUT it is dependent on the
        placement of its closest ancestor. It's kind of like an anchor on a
        ship. Wherever it goes, it's attached to the ship. If the ship doesn't
        swim down the page, neither does the anchor (oh no this analogy is not
        going well) but if the ship DOES swim down the page, so does the anchor.
        Wow, that was a informative. Relative positioning is absolute
        positioning's subtler counterpart. If absolute positioning wore Jil
        Sander, relative positioning would wear Rick Owens<a
